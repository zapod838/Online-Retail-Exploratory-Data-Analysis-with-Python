# Online-Retail-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python

### Summary:

In this project, I delved into the transactional data of an online retail store to gain valuable insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. My analysis involved conducting exploratory data analysis, where I thoroughly examined the data to identify sales patterns, detect outliers, and explore correlations within the dataset.
