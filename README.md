# Online-Retail-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python

### Summary:

In this project, I delved into the transactional data of an online retail store to gain valuable insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. My analysis involved conducting exploratory data analysis, where I thoroughly examined the data to identify sales patterns, detect outliers, and explore correlations within the dataset.


### Solutions

After conducting the analysis, I discovered that a considerable portion of the customerID data is missing in the dataset. To enhance market segmentation and customer targeting, I recommend addressing this issue. The significant difference in standard deviation indicates that outliers have a significant impact on the overall variability of the data. However, due to the specific context and goals of the analysis, removing the outliers may not be advisable, as it could have potential implications on the findings.

The line plot representing monthly sales revealed a substantial increase in sales from August to November, followed by a drop in December 2011. Additionally, by analyzing sales trends over time, I identified that November was the busiest month, and Thursdays were the busiest days of the week.

While one of the top customer IDs shows as 'Unknown' due to replacing null values, we can focus on the other customer IDs to create effective market segmentation. Moreover, knowing the most valuable items, such as 'DOTCOM POSTAGE', 'REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER', and 'PARTY BUNTING', along with the top-selling countries like 'United Kingdom', 'Netherlands', and 'EIRE', allows data-driven decision-making, optimizing operations, and maintaining competitiveness in the market.

The analysis has provided essential insights into customer behavior, market trends, and overall business performance, empowering companies to better serve their customers and achieve sustained success.


### Approach

I initiated the analysis by cleaning and preprocessing the data, computing the total sell amount, and obtaining a statistical summary of the dataset. To gain insights from the data, I employed data visualization techniques, including heat maps and sales trend analysis over time using Python's pandas library.

For outlier detection, I utilized the Z-Score method and visualized the outliers using box plots with the seaborn (sns) library.

Through these steps, I effectively processed the data, identified patterns, and detected outliers to extract meaningful information from the dataset. By leveraging data visualization and statistical methods, I gained valuable insights that contributed to a deeper understanding of the underlying trends and patterns within the data.
