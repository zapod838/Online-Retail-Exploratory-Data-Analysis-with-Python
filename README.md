# Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

### Summary:

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis on the transactional data of an online retail store. The main objective is to gain valuable insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. The analysis involves thorough examination of the data to identify sales patterns, detect outliers, and explore correlations within the dataset.

### Solutions:

After conducting the analysis, several noteworthy observations were made:

- A considerable portion of the customerID data is missing in the dataset. Addressing this issue is recommended to enhance market segmentation and customer targeting.

- The presence of outliers significantly impacts the overall variability of the data. While removing outliers may affect the findings, it is essential to consider the specific context and goals of the analysis.

- Sales trends over time revealed a substantial increase from August to November, followed by a drop in December 2011. November was identified as the busiest month, and Thursdays were the busiest days of the week.

- Top valuable items and top-selling countries were identified, providing valuable information for data-driven decision-making and optimizing business operations.

- The analysis provides crucial insights into customer behavior, market trends, and overall business performance, enabling companies to better serve their customers and achieve sustained success.

### Approach:

The analysis began with data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by computing the total sell amount and obtaining a statistical summary of the dataset. Data visualization techniques, including heat maps and sales trend analysis over time, were employed using Python's pandas library.

Outlier detection was carried out using the Z-Score method, and the outliers were visualized using box plots with the seaborn (sns) library.

Through these steps, the data was effectively processed, patterns were identified, and outliers were detected to extract meaningful information. Data visualization and statistical methods were leveraged to gain valuable insights into the underlying trends and patterns within the data.

This project demonstrates the power of exploratory data analysis in uncovering meaningful information from transactional data, providing businesses with the tools to make data-driven decisions and improve overall performance.
